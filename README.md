# SAE_base_line_for_tied_crosscoder

The code is very impromptu but contains the training script for the SAE's and the code needed for finding the cosine similarity between base and chat SAE features, and for finding what tokens each feature fires on.



The Huggingface for the SAE's is here: https://huggingface.co/matboz/SAEs_for_baseline_tied_crosscoder/tree/main
